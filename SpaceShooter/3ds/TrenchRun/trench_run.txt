This is a flat model of the Death Star trench as used in the Knightquest THX trailer.  There is a detailed area on the surface which can be used as your point of entry.  The two ends of the trench are tapered off to give the appearance of a longer trench.  There should be enough length for shots 10-15 seconds in length (depending on speed), and the maps and details repeat so that cycles can be rendered of any particular angle.

Maps have been provided for texture, bump and specularity (shininess), with an additional luminosity map to give the appearance of windows or surface lights.  If LW asks for the location of the maps, browse to the directory where the maps are kept and everything should be fine.

This scene requires Lightwave 6 or higher.  It is setup with a sample camera move similar to the trench-entry shot in A New Hope.
